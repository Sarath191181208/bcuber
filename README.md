# Bluetooth Cube Timer

A personal project to revolutionize your Rubik's Cube practice! This app connects to your Bluetooth-enabled cube, detects your solving phase (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL), automatically times your solves, generates scrambles, logs your results, and even calculates your turns per second.
